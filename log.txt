it is till issue that when i query the data from to to timestapmp not proper time stamps are showing me and i check i found that aggrgation is giving the wrong can u fix this and tell mw what is the issue why the not actual data points are not being the display test this and give me the working this and also log the all the data points at the reading so i can verify and make it fully working


u run all this and test and check theworking or not i wnat u to run theso data being write @main.go and at the same time run the @client for the query to check the all the data points of the last 50 seconds and i wnat to check the logs that data written is getteed in the query result so check the rawdata written and for the query for that time range is same and make it workable  and u run this files and test this updates u do utils its working do and so i can see the data being write is read live make this implemet
